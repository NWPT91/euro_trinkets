Just some funny little projects and tools for patching and breadboarding, including:

## Passive Attenuator
takes an input and passes thru a pot as a voltage divider, **BOOM** attenuated signal output. use a lin or log pot to your taste. (thonk-style jacks and alpha 9mm pots)

## Passive OR gate Combiner
if any signal is high it will output a high signal, else it outputs low. cool for combining different gate/trigger patterns. has an LED for fun too! (thonk-style jacks)

## Gate to Trigger
goes high on the rising edge of a gate then drops back down to low in a few milliseconds. use with OR when long gates would overlap but you want them to retrigger something. or turn a track and hold into a sample and hold...... (thonk-style jacks)

## 3u to 1u
turn that 4hp 3u module sideways and stick it in your 1u row, just because. a slim 26hp wide! m2.5 screws for the secondary mounting rails.

## 1u to 3u
want to try a little 1u but don't have the rails? this gives you 22hp worth of 1u space, sideways in 8hp of your 3u case. m2.5 screws for the secondary mounting rails.

## jackpot 2, 3, 4
mannnnnn breadboarding is a pain in the rear. make life simpler with this sturdy mount for those thonk-style jacks and alpha 9mm pots. the footprints overlap so each slot can accept a jack or a pot! just needs a few 2.54mm pin headers to slot into that breadboard.
